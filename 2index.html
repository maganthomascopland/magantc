<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>
    My full name is Magan Simone Thomas-Copland. I was born in Oklahoma on March 3rd 1999. My two parents Hattie Thomas and Robin Copland adopted me when I was 6 days old.
</p>

<p>
    I lived in Manhattan for 11 years of my life and then moved to Maine. I am very glad that I moved to Maine, because it is a lot better than living in the city.

<p>
    I have a dog named Brownie. He is 6 years old. Funny story, he was born dark brown but as he got older he changed colors to snow white. His name doesn't fit him anymore.
